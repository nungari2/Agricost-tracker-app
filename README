Agricost Tracker App ‚Äì Object-Oriented Programming in Python + SQLAlchemy
#Learning Goals
Understand the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Learn how to build and use class relationships (One-to-Many and Many-to-Many)

Work with a relational database using SQLAlchemy ORM

Build a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with data

Practice writing modular Python code using packages and files

#Key Vocab
Class: A blueprint for creating objects (e.g., Crop, Market, PriceEntry)

Object: An instance of a class

Relationship: How different classes are linked (e.g., Crop has many PriceEntries)

Session: A way to manage DB operations in SQLAlchemy

Validation: Ensuring data is correct before storing or processing

#Introduction
In this project, you're building a system to track crop prices across different markets in Kenya. The goal is to help farmers, traders, and analysts monitor prices for better decision-making.

The project uses 3 main models:

Crop ‚Äì the product being sold (e.g., Maize, Beans)

Market ‚Äì where the crop is being sold (e.g., Nairobi Market)

PriceEntry ‚Äì records the crop, market, price per kg, and date
